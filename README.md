💻 I'm a Data Scientist and Software Engineer

I am passionate about Data Engineering, Machine Learning, AI and opensource. I'm experienced in building scalable data pipelines, managing databases, and optimizing data workflows for efficient data processing. I am also deeply passionate about coffee farming and beekeeping. These activities have given me a unique perspective on sustainability and the importance of nurturing natural resources. I believe that my passion for farming has taught me important lessons about hard work, dedication, and attention to detail that are applicable to my work in data science and data engineering.
